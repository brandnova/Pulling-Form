Now, to automate the task of checking for expiring subscriptions, you can use the Django admin interface to create a cron job or use a task scheduler like Windows Task Scheduler or cron on Unix-based systems to run the management command periodically.

For example, to run the command daily, you can set up a cron job (on Unix-based systems) like this:

```plaintext
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/python /path/to/your/manage.py check_expiring_subscriptions
```

This will run the command every day at midnight.
